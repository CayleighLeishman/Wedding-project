    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To create a website that will allow for people to keep up to date on wedding thingamajigs</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>These people are probably going to be their friends and want things that are more personalized to the couple while catering to them. This is mostly an informative website so I want this website to have lots of information. Probably not going to be bombarded with lots of images though.</p>

    <p>There will also be some elderly people reading this so I need to make it easy to navigate. The most important thing is that it will be easy to use and read for each user. </p>

    <h3>Website Logo</h3>

    <img src="images/logo" alt="Logo image" /> <!-- this will be the logo of the fake last name you come up with! combine random last names -->
