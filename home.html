        <p>The date is still being planned. We are currently looking at a venu in Boise. Our thoughts for now is that
            we will get married in a temple and then hold a ring cerimony and reception in Boise, Idaho.
            Unfortunalty we have so many people that would love to be part of the temple, but we have made a hard decision that only the parents, romantic partner of the parents,
            siblings, siblings spouse's and grandparents will be able to attend the temple cerimony. However, we will be holding a ring cerimony in Boise for 
            anyone who has been sent the invatation and would like to attend. Then right after the ring cereimony we will get right to the reception and 
            dance our feets off!

        <p> 
            Our theme color for the wedding will be (website colors). We would love to see everyone dressed in these colors, but feel free to just wear your sunday best!
            Guests do not need to go out of their way to buy an expensive dress, any Sunday dress is perfect. All that matters is that we can come together
            to celebrate this day!
